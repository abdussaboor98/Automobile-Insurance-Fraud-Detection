\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Contributions and Plan}

\section{Background}
\subsection{Data Imbalance}
Data Imbalance refers to a situation in machine learning and data analysis where the distribution of classes in a dataset is highly uneven, with one class significantly outnumbering the other(s). This is common in real-world scenarios such as fraud detection, medical diagnosis, and anomaly detection, where the minority class (e.g., fraudulent claims, rare diseases) is often the most critical but underrepresented. Data imbalance poses challenges for machine learning models, as they tend to favor the majority class, leading to poor performance in predicting the minority class.
To address this, techniques such as oversampling (e.g., SMOTE Chawla et al., 2002) or undersampling can be employed. Additionally, cost-sensitive learning and ensemble methods are also effective in enhancing the model's focus on minority class predictions (He & Garcia, 2009). Proper evaluation metrics like F1-score, precision-recall curves, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) are essential for assessing performance on imbalanced datasets (FernÃ¡ndez et al., 2018).
By addressing data imbalance, models can better generalize and improve performance in critical applications, ensuring fairness and reliability in decision-making tasks.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset used in this reasearch is the \emph{carclaims.txt} data that originally made availabe as part of the Agnoss Knowlegde Seeker product. The original copy of the data is no longer available for download, but many publicly available copies are available through GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/Rashmi-77/Vehicle-Insurance-Fraud-Detection} and Kaggle\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khusheekapoor/vehicle-insurance-fraud-detection}. The dataset contains 15,420 samples of automobile insurance claims from an insurance company dor the years from 1994 to 1996. Out of the 15,420 only 923 are fraudulent claims indicating a very high imbalance in the date. This particular dataset was chosen because there are not many publicly availabe datasets on autmobile insurance fraud, and the ones that are availabe are very small. Another reason for choosing this data is that this has been extensively used in many other researches on automobile insurance fraud detection (\citealp{}), making it easy for comparative analysis.
